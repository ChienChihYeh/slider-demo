Try live demo [here](https://slider-demo-omega.vercel.app/)

### Demonstration of a React slider component with the following features:

- Complete functionality of a conventional scrollbar
- Value marks on track for contextual reference
- Clickable tag or preview thumbnail for quick overview and navigation/selection
- Ability to handle multiple tags of the same value
- Track expands dynamically upon scrolling for enhanced visibility
- Customizable thumb for aesthetic and UX preferences

Inspired by the intuitive timeline of YouTube video player and the scrollbar in VSCode, one particular use case of such design is to enhance typical sliders in medical image viewers. It allows users to mark slices of interest on the scrollbar and conveniently access additional tags and key views upon scroll or hover. An example of its implementation is in DeepLung-CAC by DeepRad.AI, where users can get a quick overview of nodule distribution on the slider and effortlessly select nodules detected by AI for further examination and editing simply by clicking on the tags.
