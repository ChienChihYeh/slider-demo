# React Slider Demo

### Demostration of a React slider component with following features:

- Full functionality of a conventional scrollbar
- Value marks on track
- Clickable tags or preview thumbnails
- Multiple tags of same value
- Expand upon scrolling
- Custom thumb

Inspired by youtube timeline and scroll bar in vscode, one of the use case for such slider is for Medical Image Viewers to mark slice of interest on the scroll bar and display additional tags and key view upon scroll or hover. One example of the actual implementation is DeepLung-CAC by DeepRad.AI, which streamlined user workflow with the use of such slider to mark nodules detected by AI, and user can simply click on the tags to select the nodules for details and editing.
